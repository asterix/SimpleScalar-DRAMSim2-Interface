# DRAMSim2 - SimpleScalar interface

The interface files here allow you to connect SimpleScalar, a MIPS processor simulator to DRAMSim2, an accurate DRAM simulator.
The idea is to allow for full system modeling with DRAM read/write delays taken into account.

I've been meaning to update the compilation and linking process to build a useful simulator executable, more coming soon...
